[The game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Letter_(card_game)).

Here's an interesting problem to solve:

Take a look at the sheets in `data/`. The idea is to generate some stats by extracting a bunch of information.

Basically, we're looking for a way to answer the following questions (for each sheet), by running a script:
- Who's the winner? *(the one with the most filled squares)*
- What's the attendance ratio for each player? *(a crossed cell means an absence)*
- Who's the worst player? *(the one with the most crossed circles)*
- ..

Got some ideas? Please help.
